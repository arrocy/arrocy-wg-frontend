<div align='center'>AWG is a Frontend-Backend management tool for interacting with the WhatsApp Web API.</div>

# History
AWG was a paid script before, but because of lack of time to continue this project, I have decided to share this for free.

# Sponsor
If you'd like to financially support me, you can do so by having a `fully-managed` Arrocy Whatsapp Gateway Cloud version (same like https://arrocy.com, but with your own domain name, your own logo, and admin access). No coding or server maintenance knowledge, you just need to provide me your domain name and your logo. All maintained (bug fixes and updates) by me.<br>
You can also donate to my crypto wallet:
